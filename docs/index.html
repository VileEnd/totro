        <h1>Totoro Daily Mission</h1>
        <p><strong>Guardian Hoot</strong>, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is of utmost importance to the forest and its inhabitants. Today's mission is critical to the harmony and well-being of the forest. Complete each task to ensure the protection and happiness of all who dwell here.</p>
        <div class="mission">
            <h2>Operation: Day of Harmony</h2>
            <h3>Objective: Secure and Maintain Forest Readiness</h3>
            <p><strong>TOP SECRET</strong></p>
            <p>—— BEGIN TRANSMISSION ——</p>
            <p><strong>~ Forest Guardian Codename: “Hoot” ~</strong></p>
            <p><strong>FOR YOUR EYES ONLY</strong></p>
            <p>Guardian Hoot, your mission, should you choose to accept it, is of utmost importance to the forest and its inhabitants. Failure is not an option. Today's mission is critical to the harmony and well-being of the forest. Your actions will significantly contribute to the protection and happiness of all who dwell here. Here is your mission for the day:</p>
            <h3>Phase 1: Dawn Patrol - Early Rise</h3>
            <div class="task">
                <input type="checkbox" id="task1">
                <label for="task1">Your mission begins at first light. Rise before the sun to ensure your readiness for the day's operations, just as Totoro greets the dawn with a stretch and a yawn. As you awaken, think of the early morning mist and the dew on the leaves. Report your status to the forest spirits immediately upon awakening.</label>
            </div>
            <h3>Phase 2: Sanctuary Tidying - Perfectly Prepare Your Nest</h3>
            <div class="task">
                <input type="checkbox" id="task2">
                <label for="task2">Conduct a thorough tidying of your living space, much like the Catbus keeps its interior spotless. A neat and tidy nest sharpens your mind and prepares you for the tasks ahead. Avoid unnecessary noise to not disturb the slumbering forest creatures. Report any irregularities immediately.</label>
            </div>
            <h3>Phase 3: Financial Fortification - Precise Collection of Forest Dues</h3>
            <div class="task">
                <input type="checkbox" id="task3">
                <label for="task3">Collect the dues from the forest's bounties with utmost precision and care, as maintaining the balance of nature is vital. This task is crucial to sustaining the harmony of the forest. Work quietly and respectfully, akin to how Satsuki and Mei respect the natural world. Submit all necessary reports to the forest spirits and confirm completion with the guardian council.</label>
            </div>
            <h3>Phase 4: Tactical Preparation - Strategically Prepare Meals</h3>
            <div class="task">
                <input type="checkbox" id="task4">
                <label for="task4">Prepare meals for today and tomorrow, ensuring they are nutritionally balanced to maintain your physical and mental sharpness, like the provisions Mei packs for her adventures. Properly store the meals and report any shortages in supplies. Be vigilant for any unusual activities near your provisions.</label>
            </div>
            <h3>Phase 5: Operational Execution - Unyielding Forest Duties</h3>
            <div class="task">
                <input type="checkbox" id="task5">
                <label for="task5">Dedicate yourself with unwavering focus to your assigned tasks, just as Totoro cares for the forest. Maintain communication with other guardians and provide continuous updates. Always work under the gentle shade of the trees or behind natural barriers to blend with the surroundings. Ensure all objectives are met before the end of your shift. Your efficiency directly impacts the forest's harmony.</label>
            </div>
            <h3>Phase 6: Evening Patrol - Safe Return to Your Nest</h3>
            <div class="task">
                <input type="checkbox" id="task6">
                <label for="task6">Secure your means of transportation (perhaps a friendly forest creature) and prepare for the journey home at dusk. Navigate your route with extreme caution and respect, like Totoro gliding through the forest. Avoid heavily trafficked paths and use secret forest trails to remain unseen. Ensure a safe return to your nest and report any incidents encountered during transit.</label>
            </div>
            <h3>Phase 7: Nightfall Protocol - Optimized Rest</h3>
            <div class="task">
                <input type="checkbox" id="task7">
                <label for="task7">Ensure you are in bed before the fireflies begin their dance to optimize rest and recovery. This is crucial for maintaining peak performance in future operations, as even Totoro needs to rest. Maintain a tranquil environment conducive to sleep, reminiscent of a peaceful night under the camphor tree. Regularly check for any potential disturbances. Report any disruptions immediately.</label>
            </div>
            <p>—— END TRANSMISSION ——</p>
            <p>Guardian Hoot, each phase of this mission is critical to our overall success. Execute each task with the utmost precision and report "mission accomplished" for each phase. Your dedication and precision are of the highest importance to the goals of the forest. Your successful operations will contribute to the protection and happiness of our magical world. Stand by for further instructions upon completing each phase.</p>
            <p>May the spirits of the forest guide you, Guardian.</p>
            <div id="congratulations" class="hidden">
                <h2>Congratulations, Guardian Hoot!</h2>
                <p>You've completed all tasks for today. The forest thanks you!</p>
